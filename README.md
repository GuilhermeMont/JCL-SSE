# JCL-SSE

A search engine for DNA/RNA/Protein sequences using JCL (JavaCá&amp;Lá)

JavaCa&La Sequence Search Engine or simply JCL-SSE. A tool for massive protein and DNA sequences alignments processing and search. It makes the use of the JCL API for the multicomputer and multi-core parallelization.  Using The Smith-Waterman with the Gotoh improvement algorithm to perform the pairwise alignments.The FASTAReader and BioJava Libraries are employed to read the data from a FASTA file database and process both Protein ans DNA sequences.

## How to run

In order to run this project you need to have JCL middleware installed.
